"""The remote control path and the queue behind it, on a private display.

WORK-273 phase 3 (spec 11, phase 3 AC): every screenshot Neutrino takes
goes through CScreencapService. test_screencap_api.py proves the HTTP
entry -- one synchronous capture, one file; this file proves the other
half, the one that got harder when the capture moved off the GUI thread:

  * a series of screenshot_count shots gets screenshot_count files,
  * an unwritable screenshot_dir falls back to /tmp and says so, and the
    outcome carries the substitution instead of reading as a clean ok,
  * /control/screenshot refuses a path as a name before writing,
  * a layer this platform cannot deliver is refused, and a capture that
    lost one is reported as having lost it rather than as a clean ok,
  * a SIGTERM in the middle of a series ends, worker and all.

Five of the seven need CScreencapService in the binary, and it lives on
neutrino's master.screencap; against a master build they skip instead of
reporting a service that was never linked in (WORK-281). The two that do
not are test_check_series_rejects_the_collision, which starts nothing,
and test_shutdown_during_a_series_ends, which asks only whether a SIGTERM
mid-series ends without a crash -- a question the legacy CScreenShot
path, with its own detached encoder thread, answers just as well.

The first of those is a regression test for a Critical defect and is the
reason this file exists (see test_every_capture_gets_its_own_file).

Which handler sees the screenshot key depends on what is on screen, so
none of these tests asserts a fixed number of files from one press. The
infobar runs a message loop of its own and forwards key_screenshot to
CNeutrinoApp::handleMsg (infoviewer.cpp), which holds the SINGLE-shot
branch, while the series lives in RealRun's own loop (neutrino.cpp) and
only inside "mode is tv/radio/webtv/webradio". Both were measured here.
What is asserted instead is the relationship between captures and files,
which holds on either branch.

# What the guard below looks for: a class name, deliberately NOT the log
# prefix in the regex above.
#
# The prefix is the tempting marker -- a binary without it cannot emit a
# single line these tests read. It is also the wrong one. If somebody
# rewords the outcome line while the service itself works, that is a
# regression in the very contract this file pins and has to go red; a
# marker drawn from the parsed text would turn precisely that regression
# into a silent skip. An existence marker has to be independent of the
# behaviour under test.
#
# The class name also covers more ground: test_http_rejects_a_path_as_name
# depends on validBasename() in the CGI and on no log line at all.
#
# It is visible because the generic build links with -rdynamic
# (make/env.mk:50), which puts every global symbol into .dynsym, where a
# strip cannot reach it. Measured on the analogue that master does have:
# CScreenShot's methods hold 20 .dynsym entries in today's binary, e.g.
# _ZN11CScreenShot8SaveFileEv. _binary_has() searches the file as raw
# bytes and finds the name inside the mangled symbol.

# Should -rdynamic ever go away, this file skips on a healthy binary --
# the survivable direction, and -rs in make/tests.mk makes it loud rather
# than silent.

    """SIGTERM with a series still in the queue ends, and does not crash.

    The worker is stopped, not abandoned: CScreencapService::stop() runs
    from ExitRun()/stop_daemons() before g_RCInput and videoDecoder go
    away, hands the waiting jobs ERR_ABORTED, lets the one in flight
    finish and joins. A shutdown that waited for all screenshot_count
    captures, or that tore the decoder out from under the worker, would
    show up here as a timeout or as a signal in the log.

    Deliberately left off the service guard the other five carry
    (WORK-281): this test reads no [screencap] line, only the exit time
    and the log's crash strings. On master the screenshot key still
    builds a CScreenShot, whose Start() leaves a detached encoder thread
    behind, so "does a SIGTERM mid-series end cleanly" is a real question
    on that half too. Guarding it would have bought a tidier skip count
    by giving up coverage that works today.

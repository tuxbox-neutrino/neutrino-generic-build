# Regression test for the overlay/paint protocol (WORK-178).
#
# Components that save the pixels underneath themselves reserve that area
# against painters in other threads, so a restore cannot undo their work. Both
# halves of that protocol hold one framebuffer-wide lock, and that lock is held
# across paint primitives - which run through CFrameBuffer::checkFbArea().
# checkFbArea() is not a passive test: with the mute icon on screen it hides and
# repaints that icon, and the icon is itself such a component, so the same
# thread takes the same lock again. A non-recursive lock froze the GUI right
# there, silently and without a crash.
#
# Muting is deliberate: it arms that mechanism. Be aware of what this test does
# NOT establish, though - it was measured against a build with the lock made
# non-recursive again, and stayed green. The re-entrant path needs a paint that
# both holds the lock and overlaps the icon rectangle, and the steps below did
# not produce one (tried with the menu centred and top-right). So this is a
# guard against the GUI locking up on these paths, not proof that a
# non-recursive lock would be caught here.
#
# What counts as "still alive" needs care. A deadlocked GUI thread does NOT
# freeze the whole screen: clock components paint from their own timer threads
# with CC_SAVE_SCREEN_NO and never take the lock, so pixels keep changing. A
# test asking "did anything change at all" would therefore pass on a deadlocked
# build. Instead each step must produce the large-area change its key is
# supposed to produce - opening or closing a full-screen menu moves tens of
# thousands of pixels, a ticking clock a few hundred.

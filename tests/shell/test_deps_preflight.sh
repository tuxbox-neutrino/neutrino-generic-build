# Covers the three behaviours that silently regressed before and would do so
# again unnoticed: that the check actually detects a missing package instead of
# only printing a list, that required and optional packages are reported as two
# separate install commands, and that a missing command is caught even when the
# package manager cannot be queried.
#
# POSIX sh, no external deps beyond the script under test. Exits 0 on success.

# Unit test for the AppImage data mapping in scripts/gen_appimage.sh.
#
# Neutrino resolves its data directories through string literals that configure
# bakes into the binary. The package therefore cannot simply carry the files --
# it has to present them at the exact path the binary was built for, which is
# what the generated AppRun does inside a private mount namespace.
#
# That mechanism has failure modes which are all invisible until someone starts
# the finished package on another machine: the data tree silently not copied,
# the writable half mounted read-only so no configuration can be saved, mounts
# escaping into the host filesystem, or a mapping step that fails and takes the
# process down instead of trying the next mechanism.
#
# Runs offline and builds nothing: a stand-in binary stands for Neutrino and
# asserts, from the inside, what Neutrino would need.
#
# POSIX sh. Exits 0 on success, 1 on any failure.
